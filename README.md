# elf\_game
A framework for simulating the elf game, allowing for testing, analysis and
evaluation of different strategies.  `sim_game.py` is an OOP framework to
perform the simulation. `stats.py` calculates statistics about the distribution
of money earned, and the other files are implementers. See `results.txt` for
the results from my data.

I know it's undocumented and uncommented and non-pep8 compliant

[Here](https://github.com/elterminad0r/elf_game/blob/master/stats.md) is an MD file with a table of statistics about each strategy.
[Here](https://github.com/elterminad0r/elf_game/blob/master/descs.md) is an MD file with scraped descriptions of each approach.
[Here](https://github.com/elterminad0r/elf_game/blob/master/spaced_figures.pdf) is a PDF with graphs of the distribution generated by each strategy.
